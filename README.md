# MicroFinance_Loan_Amount_Prediction
The Microfinance Loan Prediction Project uses Linear Regression to estimate loan amounts for small earners based on total earnings and income variability. It applies dynamic thresholds to assess eligibility, optimizing loan distribution and reducing financial risk, aiding microfinance institutions in better decision-making
1. Overview
The Microfinance Loan Amount Prediction Project helps determine loan eligibility for small earners based on their total earnings and income variability. Using Linear Regression, the model predicts loan amounts while applying dynamic thresholds to ensure fair and risk-aware lending decisions.
